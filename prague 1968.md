Six years before I was born, Russian tanks rolled into my hometown. Prague, Czechoslovakia. A country that's now been split in two, and the Russian Tanks then would have had the markings of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. But the idea was the same as Ukraine today: you belong to us, and you are getting a little uppity. An assertion of dominance.

There are important distinctions to dispense with, and I do not want to sound like I'm trivializing. For one thing, Czechoslovakia was under Russian control then in a way Ukraine is not today. There was no war, the tanks rolled with the acquiescence of all official parties, no bullets were fired. But it was enough to make an impression on my parents, 21 and 15 then, years from meeting, and their entire cohort. Twelve years later, married with two children, they would pack up whatever belongings they had and escape to America, disgusted by the prospect of a life under that kind of threat.

I have always known about these events, never quite put them together like this until the last few days. There are a lot of things you can say about Russia invading Ukraine. The official line from international law is that it is unacceptable for one country to unilaterally change the borders of another; a phrasing that almost deliberately leaves out the suffering of Ukrainians. Ukraine has throughout its history been often under the control or strong influence of Moscow. There legitimately are large Russian-aligned populations in Eastern Ukraineâ€”some of Russia's propaganda around this is less egregious than that of the United States before the Iraq invasion. On and on. But it's important not to remember the reality on the ground: tanks rolling in, asserting dominance. Reminding you that your country does not belong to you, it belongs to a bigger stronger country with a military force, and whatever dominance they exert is mercy, things can always get worse.

For a long time I told myself that Putin could deliver this message with the tanks on the other side of the border. That the threat of an invasion is just as good as an invasion itself, from this perspective. But you need to do the real invasion, with tens or hundreds of thousands of troops, before you can send in a few symbolic tanks as a comparatively gentle reminder. Here's where I remind you what the gentle reminder is: enough to change the trajectory of an entire generation. My parents, and mine. Here I am in America, a country I love and am grateful to have lived in, wondering what my life would have been like if I'd never left the
